Another part of it is being completely in the present and feeling that everything is perfect just the way things are \u0026hellip; no changes needed, I\u0026rsquo;m happy without any changes at all. But much of our motivation relies on curiosity, as well as fear (if I sit here I may become dinner for a lion). Dopamine. Also, goals are at their core cognitive dissonance. I want something to be different than what it is today, so I imagine it differently (whether that\u0026rsquo;s as simple as getting a sandwich or becoming CEO of the company). Then my brain - artificially out of homeostasis - \u0026ldquo;motivates\u0026rdquo; (to move, take action) to make those changes come about \u0026hellip; thus kicking me out of fundamental wellbeing. The question I\u0026rsquo;m trying to answer \u0026hellip; and it may be the wrong question \u0026hellip; how can I both have the motivation and stay in an enlightened state (fundamental well-being). Summary This month I\u0026rsquo;m going to focus on the topic of staying motivated while in fundamental wellbeing. To give a quick overview, this is about how people who have found various stages of enightenment (specifically location 1-4 on the Martin Matrix) and who are not retired / independently wealthy can maintain the want to do things (motivation) while staying in fundamental wellbeing.
