Premise
A core part of enlightenment is deconditioning ... meditating, training the mind to dampen dopamine and give one a sense of peace. Another part of it is being completely in the present and feeling that everything is perfect just the way things are ... no changes needed, I'm happy without any changes at all.
But much of our motivation relies on curiosity, as well as fear (if I sit here I may become dinner for a lion). Dopamine.  Also, goals are at their core cognitive dissonance.  I want something to be different than what it is today, so I imagine it differently (whether that's as simple as getting a sandwich or becoming CEO of the company). Then my brain - artificially out of homeostasis - "motivates" (to move, take action) to make those changes come about ... thus kicking me out of fundamental wellbeing.
The question I'm trying to answer ... and it may be the wrong question ... how can I both have the motivation and stay in an enlightened state (fundamental well-being).
Summary
This month I'm going to focus on the topic of staying motivated while in fundamental wellbeing. To give a quick overview, this is about how people who have found various stages of enightenment (specifically location 1-4 on the Martin Matrix) and who are not retired / independently wealthy can maintain the want to do things (motivation) while staying in fundamental wellbeing.
Simplifying Checklist
Topic: Finding motivation in fundamental wellbeing
Why would people want to do that - other than avoidance of pain?
Target Market: Finders who are not retired / independently wealthy (are there other segments?)
Industry: neuroscience / positive spychology
**Result**: What is the result of having more motivation?  Living the life you truly want, not being on the mountain, leaving a legacy, having a meaningful life [but why would they care?]

Question: How can motivation be retained and improved when in fundamental wellbeing #topic
What is fundamental wellbeing?
What are people's experiences of motivation when in fundamental wellbeing?
What are the core attributes of motivation both with and without fundamental wellbeing?
Why would want to be motivated?  Motivation, it's turtles all the way down - what is the turtle standing on? Core entropy as the arrow of time moves forward.
What  ways to motivate ourselves other than avoidance of pain?
Is there a fundamental rightness / necessity to the world that we should be striving for (goal oriented vs. exploration oriented from above)
Who can I talk to about motivation that also has experience with fundamental wellbeing?
