Summary

This month I'm going to focus on the topic of staying motivated while in fundamental well-being. To give a quick overview, this is about how people who have found various stages of enlightenment (specifically location 1-4 on the Martin Matrix) and who are not retired / independently wealthy can maintain the want to do things (motivation) while staying in fundamental wellbeing.

Simplifying Checklist

  + Topic: Finding motivation in fundamental well-being

    + Why would people want to do that - other than avoidance of pain?

  + Target Market: Finders who are not retired / independently wealthy (are there other segments?)

  + Industry: neuroscience / positive spychology

  + **Result**: What is the result of having more motivation?  Living the life you truly want, not being on the mountain, leaving a legacy, having a meaningful life [but why would they care?]

  + What about motivation is interesting
