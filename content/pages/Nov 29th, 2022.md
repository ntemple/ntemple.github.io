What about motivation is interesting

Body of work that increases in value over time

According to Helen Fisher’s work, primary brain chemistry will have an influence on how curious someone is … Someone high Dopamine will be constantly curious, someone high serotonin is so easily contented will be less curious - not good bad, right wrong to have those propensities.

Pre-Mortem
Assume you didn't post this month, why?
Didn't learn anything distillable in a single day (material too dense)
Tired, brain overload
What can you do now to avoid this?
Make it ok to post something really small and obvious
Create backup posts that can be used if I really don't have anything
Mindset
If I found it useful enough to post, others will find useful enough to learn
Be relational (what does this mean?)
Letting go of perfectionism - find the most interesting notes from those
